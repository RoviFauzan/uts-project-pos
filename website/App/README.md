# Kasir App - Export Functionality

## PDF Export Setup

To enable PDF exports, you need to install the mPDF library using Composer. 
Follow these steps:

1. Make sure Composer is installed on your system
2. Navigate to the App directory: `cd c:\xampp\htdocs\kasir-app-main\App`
3. Run: `composer install`

If you don't have Composer or don't want to install it, you can still export to Excel format,
which doesn't require any additional libraries.
